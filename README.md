# Khodam Checker

## Project Overview
The "Khodam Checker" project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to predict the type of khodam (a mystical spiritual entity) associated with a given name. The app randomly generates predictions and displays them alongside random images from a predefined collection.

## Features
- **Random Khodam Prediction** : The app takes a name as input and uses Python's random library to predict the type of khodam associated with that name.
- **Random Image Display** : Along with the prediction, the app displays a random image from the "ghost_photo" folder, adding a visual element to the experience.

## How It Works
1. Input: Users enter a name into the app.
2. Prediction: The app uses the random library to select a khodam type from a predefined list.
3. Image Display: The app selects and displays a random image from the "ghost_photo" folder that corresponds with the prediction.
4. Output: The result is shown on the screen with the predicted khodam type and the accompanying image.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit
- A collection of images placed in the "ghost_photo" folder
